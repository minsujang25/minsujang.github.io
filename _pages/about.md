I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Pittsburgh. My research interests lie at the intersection of scientific modeling of political behavior and political information processing.  My dissertation investigates the impact of cognitive bias on information source credibility assessment and its social consequences, with a particular emphasis on information outlet choice and macro-level political belief distribution. Through a sophisticated combination of agent-based modeling and simulation techniques, I unravel the multifaceted interplay between cognitive biases, credibility assessments, and social interactions. I am also interested in behavioral modeling and the controlled experiments with human subjects. 

Before joining the University of Pittsburgh, I earned my BA and MA in Political Science at Dongguk University, Seoul, South Korea. During this period, I worked as a research assistant for a survey project measuring the ideological orientation of all candidates running for the Republic of Korea National Assembly. I also served as a teaching assistant for Quantitative Research Methodology at the graduate level in Seoul National University. These experiences significantly enhanced my understanding of diverse research methodologies and profoundly influenced my academic journey.
