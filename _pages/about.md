I am a postdoctoral research fellow within the ConsNet project at the University of Milano-Bicocca and the BehaveLab at the University of Milan. ConsNet is an inter-university project studying conspiracy beliefs, their social network determinants (both online and offline), and their impacts on public health-related behaviors. My research interests lie at the intersection of scientific modeling of political information processing and political behavior.

My dissertation investigates the impact of cognitive bias on information source credibility assessment and its social consequences, with a particular emphasis on information outlet choice and macro-level political belief distribution. Through a sophisticated combination of agent-based modeling and simulation techniques, I unravel the multifaceted interplay between cognitive biases, credibility assessments, and social interactions.

Before joining the ConsNet project, I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Pittsburgh in 2024. During my doctoral studies, I worked at the Pitt Disinformation Lab, which combats disinformation by strengthening social connections within the regional community. My research employs a variety of methods, including computational and behavioral modeling, controlled experiments, and computational tools such as text-as-data and machine learning.
